This is the data repository for the Turkish Poetry Corpus (TPC) v1. You can download Turkish_Poetry_Corpus.txt to access the raw corpus, which can be imported directly into corpus software such as AntConc. The raw corpus can also be downloaded as .csv and .xml files. Both files contain metadata such as poem id. Finally, the Turkish_Poetry_Corpus_Tokenized.csv file contains all the words in the TPC. Please see https://huggingface.co/datasets/okg/turkish-poems/ for the original data set and https://huggingface.co/datasets/beratcmn/turkish-poems-cleaned for the cleaned version (train.json). If you want to work with more metadata, please download train.json. The next version will include annotations.
